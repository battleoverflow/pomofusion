# PomoFusion

A simple Pomodoro timer with a Spotify integration.

Currently, PomoFusion only support playback controls with no other functionality. This means while the playback is controlled automatically, things such as shuffling, changing the current playing track, etc. must be modified in the Slack application.

## FAQ / Help Guide

> [!IMPORTANT] PomoFusion is unable to locate a device. Help?
> Spotify may have a difficult time locating your active device or session. A potential fix for this is to restart the Spotify application, play a song for a few seconds, and then pause the song. Once you've done this, Spotify shouldn't have any issues locating your active session.

> [!IMPORTANT] I'm not receiving any notifications from PomoFusion. What's wrong?
> First, make sure you've alloted the proper permissions for the application. I've attached a screenshot below.
